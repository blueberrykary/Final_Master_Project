  utter_art_program:
  - text: "Art Design Option Program Details \n\n The Department of Art and Design programs at California State University, Dominguez Hills are characterized by a unique and close correlation among the Art History, Studio Art, and Design Options, and by a strong coordination among the different studio areas. \n\n These Options introduce students to potential careers in the art world as well as providing personal fulfillment through creative and scholarly endeavors. \n\n Although a minor is not required, those who foresee a career in art are encouraged to complete a minor in the Department of Art and Design. Some courses are offered in the evening to allow flexible schedules."

  utter_business_admin_description:
  - text: "The undergraduate program in Business Administration, which leads to a Bachelor of Science degree, is designed to accomplish two objectives. \n\n The first of these is to prepare students for lifelong professional careers in commerce, finance and industry, as well as for management careers in the public and not-for-profit sectors. A second objective is to provide students with the knowledge and skills needed to obtain professional, entry level positions in one functional area of the business enterprise, or in some particular field of business. \n\n After that, students must select a concentration. The following courses, or their approved transfer equivalents, are required of all candidates for this degree.
Because most Business Administration course work completed over ten years ago is outdated, students must consult with an advisor in the Student Advisement and Service Center to ascertain whether courses taken ten or more years ago will need to be repeated. The Associate Dean in the College of Business Administration and Public Policy may waive the requirement to repeat outdated course work if there is evidence that student knowledge is current. Such evidence may consist of recent successful completion of more advanced course work in the specific discipline or satisfactory completion of designated national examinations. "
  utter_business_admin:
  - text: "Admission to the Business Administration major requires completion of all lower division Business Administration core courses with minimum grades of “C”. All new majors are classified as “pre-business majors” until the requirements are met. Upper division advanced and concentration courses are available only to “Business Administration” majors. Students should consult with an advisor in the Business Advisement Center for more information."

  utter_comp_sci:
  - text: "The curriculum is designed to provide preparation for professional careers in the areas of software design and applied computer science, as well as to give the necessary theoretical background for graduate study in the field and to allow a flexible response to a dynamic and growing profession. \n\n The required courses give students a firm foundation in the basic areas of computer science and related areas of mathematics, and a wide choice of electives allow them to tailor their program to their specific interests. \n\n The baccalaureate program (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science) is accredited by the Computer Science Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202-4012, (410) 347-7700. The programs accredited by the Commission of Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology are accredited as separate and distinct from any other programs or kinds of accreditation."

  utter_comp_sci_req:
  - text: " Students entering the Computer Science program must complete the following. \n\n Earn an overall grade point average of 2.0 or better in courses taken outside of the department.\n\n Earn a grade of C or better in each course taken within the department. \n\n Earn a grade of C or better in all direct and indirect prerequisite courses listed in the catalog before advancing to the next level course in a sequence for English, Mathematics, and Science courses. \n\n Students must take capstone course CSC 492 at CSUDH."
